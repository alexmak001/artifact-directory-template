Title:
Maritime Ship Detection in Satellite Imagery

Abstract:
Satellites are being launched into space at an exponential rate and are able to produce high quality images in relatively short intervals of time on any part of Earth. The amount of data and types of it are also increasing significantly and in this paper we specifically use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery in order to detect ships traveling through bodies of water. We created a ship counting tool that intakes a start date, end date, and an area of interest and returns the number of ships for each day between the two dates. We propose a new method where the images are first classified into offshore or inshore and a separate object detection algorithm counts the number of ships per image. The classifier and object detection networks are trained using the Large-Scale SAR Ship Detection Dataset-v1.0 (LS-SSDD-v1.0) and deployed on Google Earth Engine.
